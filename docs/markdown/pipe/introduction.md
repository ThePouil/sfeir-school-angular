# Angular and its already existing pipes <br>

-   currency
-   date
-   lowercase
-   async
-   json
-   decimal
-   percent

<!-- .element: class="big-code" -->

Notes:

-   async is very useful for resolving observables in the template
-   json allows to display "pretty" variables (object, array) in the template (useful for debugging)
-   very useful date to display a date in a certain format (can work with time)
