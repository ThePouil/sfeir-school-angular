# A little word on Material Design <br>

-   TP uses Material Design components (mat-toolbar, mat-checkbox, mat-card ...)
-   This formation is not about the Material Design, nor the Angular Material directives <br> <br>
-   Your projects are not required to use Material Design <br> <br>

<!-- .element: class="big-code" -->

Notes:

-   Material Design is an ensemble of Design directives established by Google. This design consists of spraying our components and rendering more 'rounded'<br> <br>
    There are other design frameworks:
-   materialize
-   bootstrap / ng-bootstrap
